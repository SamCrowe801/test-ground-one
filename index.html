                        <p>She learned a valuable lesson: You can take the girl out of Utah, but you can't take the Utah out of the girl. Also Pennsylvania probably just wasn't it.</p>

                    <p>She cleaned crime scenes, built stuff, cleaned ski resort rooms, cared for people, survived Pennsylvania (barely), vibed in Denver, and eventually came home. That's called RANGE, folks.</p>
